# guessing_game
This game is a guessing game that works with the GPIO pins connected to the raspberry pi. 
The user guesses a random number from 1 to 99: if the number is too the light would appear in "yellow", 
if the number is too high it would appear in "red". The game would continue to loop until it's guessed correctly - then it would appear in "green".
